# NF1

Problem Statement Defined as follows

Neurofibromatosis (NF) are genetic disorders that cause tumors to grow on nerve tissue. NF tumors may be benign or malignant. There is not a reliable way to predict if a tumor will be benign or malignant.


Solution Approach

Project aim of the solution is to develop an artificial intelligence model that uses genomics, imaging, clinical, and demographics data to predict if an NF tumor will be benign or malignant.

#TargetAchievedinPhases

Product Roadmap

Phase 1 - genetic analysis of benign and malignant NF tumors.
Phase 2 - deep learning analysis of genomic, imaging, clinical, and demographics data to predict if a tumor will be benign or malignant.
Phase 3 - scale our deep learning solution as a product or service.
